# pyrate

pyrate is a small code base designed to integrate reaction rates from astrophysical S-factor data generated by [AZURE2](https://azure.nd.edu). It takes in reaction information and AZURE output data through a JSON configuration file.

## Install

After downloading this repository, the python dependencies (numpy, scipy) need to be installed, if they aren't already present on the machine. For convience, a requirements.txt file is present in the repository. One can then install the dependencies using pip as `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is recommended to install the requirements to a virtual environment.

## Use

Once dependencies are installed, run pyrate as `python main.py <your_config>` where `<your_config>` is a JSON file containing the relevant data for running pyrate.
pyrate will rate the rate as a function of temperature to an output file specified in the configuration.

### Configuration

Configuration files must contain the fields:

    - `Z_projectile`: projectile proton number
    - `A_projectile`: projectile mass number
    - `Z_target`: target proton number
    - `A_target`: target mass number
    - `Sfactor_file`: path to AZURE data file
    - `output_file`: path to which rate will be written
    - `T_min`: starting temperature of the calculation (in GK)
    - `T_max`: final temperature of the calculation (in GK)
    - `T_step`: temperature step size (in GK)

## Requirements

python 3.10
numpy
scipy
